.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
In NFD, the routing information base (RIB) stores static or dynamic routing information
registered by applications, operators, and NFD itself.
Each \fIroute\fP in the RIB indicates that contents under a name prefix may be available via a nexthop.
A route contains a name prefix, a nexthop face, the origin, a cost, and a set of route inheritance flags;
refer to NFD Management protocol for more information.
.sp
The \fBnfdc route list\fP command lists RIB routes, optionally filtered by nexthop and origin.
.sp
The \fBnfdc route show\fP command shows RIB routes at a specified name prefix.
.sp
The \fBnfdc route add\fP command requests to add a route.
If a route with the same prefix, nexthop, and origin already exists,
it is updated with the specified cost, route inheritance flags, and expiration period.
This command returns when the request has been accepted, but does not wait for RIB update completion.
.sp
The \fBnfdc route remove\fP command removes a route with matching prefix, nexthop, and origin.
.sp
The \fBnfdc fib list\fP command shows the forwarding information base (FIB),
which is calculated from RIB routes and used directly by NFD forwarding.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <PREFIX>
Name prefix of the route.
.TP
.B <FACEID>
Numerical identifier of the face.
It is displayed in the output of \fBnfdc face list\fP and \fBnfdc face create\fP commands.
.TP
.B <FACEURI>
An URI representing the remote endpoint of a face.
In \fBnfdc route add\fP command, it must uniquely match an existing face.
In \fBnfdc route remove\fP command, it must match one or more existing faces.
.TP
.B <ORIGIN>
Origin of the route, i.e. who is announcing the route.
The default is 255, indicating a static route.
.TP
.B <COST>
The administrative cost of the route.
The default is 0.
.TP
.B no\-inherit
Unset CHILD_INHERIT flag in the route.
.TP
.B capture
Set CAPTURE flag in the route.
.TP
.B <EXPIRATION\-MILLIS>
Expiration time of the route, in milliseconds.
When the route expires, NFD removes it from the RIB.
The default is infinite, which keeps the route active until the nexthop face is destroyed.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT CODES
